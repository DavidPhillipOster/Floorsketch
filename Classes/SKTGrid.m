KVC's direct instance variable access, KVO's autonotifying, and KVO's property dependency mechanism make them unnecessary. If in the future we decide that we need to do more complicated things when these values are gotten or set we can add getter and setter methods then, and no bound object will know the difference (so don't let me hear any more guff about direct ivar access "breaking encapsulation").
