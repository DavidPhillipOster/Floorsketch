/* This class is KVC and KVO compliant for these keys:

 "flippedHorizontally" and "flippedVertically" (boolean NSNumbers; read-only) - Whether or not the image is flipped relative to its natural orientation.

 "filePath" (an NSString containing a path to an image file; write-only) - the scriptable property that can specified as an alias in the record passed as the "with properties" parameter of a "make" command, so you can create images via AppleScript.

 In FloorSketch "flippedHorizontally" and "flippedVertically" are two more of the properties that SKTDocument observes so it can register undo actions when they change. Also, "imageFilePath" is scriptable.
