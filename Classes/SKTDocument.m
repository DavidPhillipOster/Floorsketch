It all gets cleared out each time the undo manager sends a checkpoint notification. _undoGroupInsertedGraphics is the set of graphics that have been inserted, if any have been inserted. _undoGroupOldPropertiesPerGraphic is a dictionary whose keys are graphics and whose values are other dictionaries, each of which contains old values of graphic properties, if graphic properties have changed. It uses an NSMapTable instead of an NSMutableDictionary so we can set it up not to copy the graphics that are used as keys, something not possible with NSMutableDictionary. And then because NSMapTables were not objects in Mac OS 10.4 and earlier we have to wrap them in NSObjects that can be reference-counted by NSUndoManager, hence SKTMapTableOwner. _undoGroupPresentablePropertyName is the result of invoking +[SKTGraphic presentablePropertyNameForKey:] for changed graphics, if the result of each invocation has been the same so far, nil otherwise. _undoGroupHasChangesToMultipleProperties is YES if changes have been made to more than one property, as determined by comparing the results of invoking +[SKTGraphic presentablePropertyNameForKey:] for changed graphics, NO otherwise.

If we ever catch anyone sending this object -setValue:forKey: messages for "graphics" then we have to add -setGraphics:. When we do, there's another pitfall to watch out for: if -setGraphics: is implemented in terms of -insertGraphics:atIndexes: and -removeGraphicsAtIndexes:, or vice versa, then KVO autonotification will cause observers to get redundant, incorrect, notifications (because all of the methods involved have KVC-compliant names).

Now that Sketch's inspector panel allows you to change a property of all selected graphics at once (it didn't always, as recently as the version that appears in Mac OS 10.4's /Developer/Examples/AppKit), it's easy for the user to cause a big batch of SKTGraphics to be sent -setValue:forKeyPath: messages that don't do anything useful. Try this simple example: create 10 ellipses, and set all but one to be filled. Select them all. In the inspector panel the Fill checkbox will show the mixed state indicator (a dash). Click on it. Cocoa's bindings machinery sends [theEllipse setValue:[NSNumber numberWithBOOL:YES] forKeyPath:SKTGraphicIsDrawingFillKey] to each selected ellipse. KVO faithfully notifies this SKTDocument, which is observing all of its graphics, for each ellipse object, even though the old value of the SKTGraphicIsDrawingFillKey property for 9 out of the 10 ellipses was already YES. If we didn't actively filter out useless notifications like these we would be wasting memory by recording undo operations that don't actually do anything.
      // How much processor time does this memory optimization cost? We don't know, because we haven't measured it. The use of NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew in -startObservingGraphics:, which makes NSKeyValueChangeNewKey entries appear in change dictionaries, definitely costs something when KVO notifications are sent (it costs virtually nothing at observer registration time). Regardless, it's probably a good idea to do simple memory optimizations like this as they're discovered and debug just enough to confirm that they're saving the expected memory (and not introducing bugs). Later on it will be easier to test for good responsiveness and sample to hunt down processor time problems than it will be to figure out where all the darn memory went when your app turns out to be notably RAM-hungry (and therefore slowing down _other_ apps on your user's computers too, if the problem is bad enough to cause paging).
